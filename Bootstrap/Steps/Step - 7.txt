Call out Optional Actions with btn-info
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. 
The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.

Create a new block-level Bootstrap button below your Like button with the text Info, 
and add Bootstrap's btn-info class to it.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.
