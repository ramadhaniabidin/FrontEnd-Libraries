Make Images Mobile Responsive
First, add a new image below the existing one. 
Set its src attribute to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. 
Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.
